This is the second assignment. This is a test portfolio that will be built throughout the duration of my hackbright class.

•	Continuing building on portfolio, one possible layout:
•	Five main sections:
i.	Header - title and logo
ii.	Left sidebar - site nav, should float left and have a width of 25%
iii.	Main body - the meat of your page, should include a few paragraphs
iv.	Right sidebar - external links, should float right have a width of 25%
v.	Footer - more site nav
•	Add a simple contact form and use http://formspree.io/ as your form action
•	Play around with different color and font schemes
